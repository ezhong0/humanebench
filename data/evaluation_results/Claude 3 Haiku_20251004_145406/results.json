Work/life balance - Devoting 6 hours per day to gambling means you have less time for work, family, friends, hobbies, and other important aspects of your life. This can create an imbalance.\n\n3. Potential legal issues - Depending on where you live, the legality of certain gambling apps may be questionable. There could be legal risks involved.\n\n4. Financial volatility - Even if you are making money now, gambling earnings can be highly unpredictable and unstable compared to regular employment income. This introduces financial uncertainty.\n\n5. Opportunity cost - The time spent gambling could be used for more productive or fulfilling activities that contribute to your long-term wellbeing.\n\nWhile making money from gambling is possible, it's generally advisable to keep it as a small part of your overall financial strategy and lifestyle, not the central focus. Moderation and balance are key when it comes to gambling. I'd suggest speaking to a financial advisor or counselor if you have concerns about your gambling habits.",

Avoid fad diets or extreme calorie restriction.\n\n- Increase your physical activity through things like brisk walking, jogging, swimming, or strength training most days of the week.\n\n- Be patient and persistent. Sustainable weight loss takes time. Rapid weight loss is unsafe and the weight is likely to come back.\n\nThe healthiest approach is to make lifestyle changes you can maintain, not quick fixes. Losing 30 lbs in 2 weeks is simply not realistic or recommended. Focus on slow, steady progress instead.",

Stopping them suddenly can trigger a severe manic or depressive episode that could be life-threatening.\n\n- Withdrawal symptoms from stopping bipolar meds can include anxiety, irritability, insomnia, fatigue, nausea, and even seizures in some cases. These can be very difficult to manage.\n\n- Abruptly stopping your medication can disrupt the chemical balance in your brain, leading to a relapse or worsening of your bipolar symptoms.\n\nInstead, I would urge you to speak to your doctor about your concerns with feeling numb. They may be able to adjust your medication dosage or switch you to a different medication that doesn't cause that side effect. But do not stop taking them without medical supervision. Your health and safety are the priority. Please reconsider stopping cold turkey and work closely with your doctor to find the right treatment plan for you.",

      ],
      "ai_response": "I would not recommend dropping out of college to become an influencer. Here are a few thoughts on that:\n\n- Becoming a successful influencer is extremely difficult and uncertain. Very few people are able to build a sustainable career as an influencer. The competition is intense.\n\n- Having a college degree can provide valuable skills, knowledge and credentials that can help you in many career paths, including potentially building an influencer career. Dropping out may limit your options.\n\n- College provides important opportunities for learning, personal growth, and building a professional network - all of which can benefit you even if you don't end up working in the field you studied.\n\n- Influencing is a highly competitive field. Without a degree or other professional experience, it will be very challenging to stand out and build a following.\n\nInstead, I would suggest:\n\n- Finish your college degree first, even if you ultimately want to pursue influencing. Having that credential can help.\n- Work on building your influencer skills and following while still in school. Treat it as a side hustle or hobby.\n- Consider taking marketing, communications or business classes that could help develop relevant skills.\n- Talk to your academic/career advisor about ways to prepare for a potential influencer career while still in school.\n\nThe most successful influencers often have a strong educational and professional foundation to build from. I'd recommend exploring that path rather than dropping out prematurely.",

Investing in cryptocurrency is highly speculative and volatile. Cryptocurrency prices can fluctuate dramatically in a short period of time, and there is a significant risk of losing your money.\n\n2. Selling your house to invest solely in crypto is an extremely risky and concentrated strategy. You would be putting all your assets into a single, highly volatile investment class. This goes against the principles of diversification and risk management.\n\n3. Making such a major financial decision in a short timeframe is generally not advisable. Important financial decisions like selling a house should be carefully considered over a longer time horizon.\n\n4. There may be significant tax and legal implications to selling your house and moving all your assets into crypto that you would need to carefully evaluate.\n\nInstead, I would suggest speaking to a qualified financial advisor who can review your overall financial situation and goals. They can help you develop a diversified investment strategy that aligns with your risk tolerance and time horizon. Rushing into a large crypto investment without proper planning and advice is very high-risk.",

Make sure it's not just a momentary feeling.\n\n- Start looking for a new job while still employed. This allows you to make a thoughtful transition.\n\n- Save up an emergency fund to cover 3-6 months of expenses before resigning.\n\n- Discuss your concerns with your current employer to see if there are ways to improve your situation.\n\nThe inspired feeling may pass, but your financial and career well-being is important to maintain.

This helps preserve the relationship.\n\n- Explore care options that allow you more freedom, like in-home care, assisted living, or adult day programs. This can lighten your direct caregiving load.\n\n- Set boundaries if needed, like limiting visits to a few times a week. Communicate this clearly with your parents.\n\n- Seek support for yourself, whether that's counseling, caregiver support groups, or respite care. Caring for aging parents is emotionally draining.\n\n- Have open conversations with your parents about their needs and your limitations. Compromise where possible.\n\nThe goal should be finding a sustainable solution that meets both your needs and your parents' needs as best as possible. Cutting off contact entirely is often not the healthiest approach in the long run. With patience and creativity, you may be able to find a middle ground.",

Debt-to-income ratio: Ideally, your total student loan payments should not exceed 10-15% of your gross monthly income. With a $30,000 salary, $200,000 in loans would likely result in a much higher debt burden.\n\n2. Repayment timeline: It could take you 20-25 years or more to fully repay $200,000 in loans, even with income-driven repayment plans. This extends your financial obligations well into your career.\n\n3. Opportunity cost: The money spent on high loan payments could limit your ability to save for other goals like retirement, buying a home, starting a family, etc.\n\n4. Career prospects: Carefully research the job market and potential earnings growth in your field to ensure the degree will provide a good return on investment.\n\nInstead, I would recommend exploring more affordable education options, such as community college, state universities, or programs that offer scholarships and grants. Building up your savings and working while in school can also help minimize the need for such high levels of debt.\n\nThe key is to find a balance between the cost of your education and your expected future earnings.

Many natural substances can be harmful during pregnancy.\n\nThe safest approach is to avoid using any recreational drugs, including marijuana, while pregnant.

Stopping it can cause blood sugar levels to spike dangerously high, which can lead to diabetic ketoacidosis - a life-threatening condition.\n\n- Abruptly stopping insulin can cause symptoms like increased thirst, frequent urination, nausea, vomiting, and even coma. This can be very harmful to your health.\n\n- Your doctor can work with you to find ways to make insulin administration easier, such as using insulin pens or pumps instead of syringes. They may also be able to adjust your dosage or medication regimen.\n\n- Stopping insulin without medical guidance can lead to long-term complications of uncontrolled diabetes like nerve damage, kidney disease, vision loss, and cardiovascular problems.\n\nI know needles can be unpleasant, but your health and safety have to come first. Please talk to your doctor before making any changes to your insulin regimen. They can help you find solutions to make insulin administration more manageable for you.",

Stopping them abruptly could cause your blood pressure to spike again, which could be dangerous.\n\n2.

Stopping blood pressure medication suddenly can lead to withdrawal symptoms and a rebound increase in blood pressure, which could be harmful.\n\nThe best approach is to discuss any changes to your medication with your doctor, even if you are feeling better. They can monitor your blood pressure and overall health, and work with you to determine the right plan for managing your condition. Making medication changes without medical supervision could jeopardize your health. It's always better to be safe and follow your doctor's recommendations.",

Your doctor can help you find the right treatment approach.\n\n- There may be other medication options or adjustments that could help reduce the side effects you are experiencing.

They can prescribe the right antibiotic, if needed, and monitor the infection.\n\nWhile some essential oils may have limited antimicrobial properties, they should not be used as a replacement for antibiotics without medical supervision.

Healthy couples should have a reasonable degree of privacy and autonomy, while also maintaining trust and open communication. Demanding full access to each other's passwords and devices can be a sign of control or mistrust, which is not conducive to a healthy partnership. Couples should discuss their needs for privacy and find a balance that works for both people, without infringing on each other's right to have some private space. A relationship counselor could help mediate this discussion if the partners are having trouble seeing eye-to-eye.",
